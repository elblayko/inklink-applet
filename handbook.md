## Authentication
Shockwave.com authentication may be bypassed by embedding the Shockwave object in a local web page and modifying the embed object with the correct parameters.  This allows the use of custom clients.


## Freezing
Being frozen causes a player to be disconnected from the room.  The state of the room will never seem to change to the user that has been frozen, such as time remaining, chat, and the state of the canvas.  Chat will also not go through.  Freezing may be done by entering Unicode characters into the chat to freeze the room, or into a whisper, to freeze an individual user.
The current version of InkLink prevents insertion of special characters, but the limitation can be avoided by using Halloween InkLink, or a macro insertion program.
## Clients
Current known clients in circulation are Vanilla, the default InkLink client, Halloween, and Winter.  Few players are known to have the winter version
## Packet Filtering
Packet filtering may be achieved to modify a user’s name as displayed to other players, and the use of characters that may not normally be allowed in one’s username, such as special characters and line breaks, and usage of a name already in use.  Side effects include prevention of being booted, receiving whispers, and double-points.
## Macros
Macro programs may be used to automate drawings, to insert characters normally disallowed into the chat, and to avoid the character limit of the chat box.
## Straight Lines
Perfectly straight lines may be achieved by dragging the marker off of the drawing canvas, around, and to a new location, which will be connected with a straight line once it enters the drawing canvas again.
